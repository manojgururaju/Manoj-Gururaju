- [Banana price estimation](https://www.kaggle.com/manojgururaju/banana-price-prediction-and-eda)
We had planted Nendran banana plants in our farmland we wanted to know the expected price of the crop during the harvest and during what time of the year we can expect more price so that we can plan our plantation and budget the entire process. unfortunately due to lockdown and middlemen exploitations we couldnt get the expected value we end up having half of the  price what we have predicted :(

- Posture Correction, Break Suggestioin, Eye care and Todo Application:
Due WFH situation lot of things impacted and especially our health. We would sit for long hours, might be in un-healthy postures causing back pains, stare screen for longer duration causing dry eyes and may forget to drink water. I was suffering from all these issues, So I wanted to fix them using deep learning. I have used Tensorflow Posenet model
for identifying keypoints and developed an algorithm that can help us solving issue by using the metadata got from the model. Project is not hosted yet and in my private repo, will be making it open source soon.
